The Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP) (*Diaphorina citri*) is a major citrus pest. The species has been introduced to western and eastern Africa, but has not yet spread to South Africa, where it could have a devastating impact on citrus farming and livelihoods. A proactive response is key to mitigating the speciesâ€™ impacts, particularly the ongoing monitoring of potential invasion routes and entry points into South Africa under current and projected future climate conditions. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) under current and future climates for ACP in Africa, and used these models to i) determine where the species likely poses a threat, ii) identify potential invasion routes into South Africa, and iii) assess how these factors will change under climate change. The SDMs indicated that there is an almost contiguous band of suitable climate along the east coast of Africa that joins the species current range in East Africa to South Africa, and under climate change this route may include a potential route through Namibia and Botswana. Much of South Africa is climatically suitable for the species, but under climate change these areas are likely to shift further inland. We are unlikely to prevent the spread of ACP into South Africa, but the outputs of these models will inform monitoring activities and assist with preparations to respond to this biological invasion.
